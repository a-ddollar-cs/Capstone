## Narrative

### What is it?

  This project is a flutter app that came from a Facebook post in a groupf centered around hunting that I am apart of. The post asked the group if there are any resources that they wish were available to hunters. In the comments of this post, someone had mentioned that they wish there was an easy way to ask permission to hunt on someone's land. After reading this comment, Land Buddy was born. Land Buddy is an application that is similar to AirBnb, however, rather than being centered around booking someone's house or apartment, your booking is used for grant access to private property. While the original intent of the app began as centered around hunting, I xpanded the functionality, to include requests for access for any purpose, such as camping, hiking, fishing, easements for getting through the land, piloting drones above it, the list goes on. In its current state, this project allows for users to create an account, and switch between the land owner view and renter view. Land owners canpost their land for access purposes, where they specify details about the property, include a picture, post any rules regarding what is allowed, and their contact information if any issues arise. Renters will be able to see all available properties, and they can see details about them, then they can book a "stay" or access period on a calendar. This calendar booking will then be available to both the renter and the land owner.
